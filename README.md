## Exercises + Description

Here is a list of exercises related to Markdown and programming:

### Exercise 1

- [Exercise1](exercise1.md)
  This Markdown file is an example for practicing basic Markdown syntax, including headings, links, images, lists, and code blocks. It serves as a structured learning resource for understanding essential Markdown elements.

### Exercise 2

- [Exercise2](exercise2.md)
  This documentation provides an overview of fundamental Git commands, explaining their functions and usage in a structured table format. Additionally, it offers practical tips for Git workflow, such as checking the repository status using `git status` to view changes in the working directory and staging area before committing or pushing updates.

### Exercise 3

- [Exercise3](exercise3.md)
  This documentation focuses on setting up and managing a Java project using Maven and Git. A simple calculator application, configure dependencies, and automate the build process with Maven.

### Exercise 4

- [Exercise4](exercise4.md)
  This project contains comprehensive JUnit tests for the `Calculator` class, covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorial operations.  
  Although `assertThrows()` was not required in Ãœbung04, a test for division by zero using `assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class)` has been included as an additional safeguard and best practice.

### Exercise5

- [Exercise5](exercise5.md)  
  This exercise introduces logging with Log4j2. It explains the purpose of logging libraries, describes the available log levels in Log4j, and outlines the various configuration options such as appenders, and layouts.  
  A template configuration file (`log4j2.xml.template`) is provided, while the actual configuration is excluded from version control for portability and flexibility.

- [log4j2.xml.template](src/main/resources/log4j2.xml.template) *(template config file)*

### Exercise6

- [Exercise6](exercise6.md)  
 This documentation explains how to configure and generate a Maven Site, including the integration of custom Markdown pages, JavaDoc API documentation, and JaCoCo test coverage reports.  
  It also outlines the purpose of the `site.xml` and `pom.xml` files and highlights the required and recommended plugins for building professional project documentation using Maven.
